      <description>We took the &amp;lsquo;krankenwagen&amp;rsquo; to Gorges du Verdon. It took us three days to get there. The van is pretty slow and steep hills are not its speciality, so taking pit-stops is the way to travel.
We were afraid the van could not climb the steep parts of the French Alps, but luckily we got there without trouble.
I was a lovely quiet campsite, we had a spot near the river and a lot of sunshine.</description>

      <description>We decided to buy an old german ambulance to turn it into a camper.
We started by stripping everything and putting in a new floor
Next up where the walls. The original plan was to use big duplex panels for a entire wall. We came to the realisation that it&amp;rsquo;s near impossible to get neat, so we went with wooden paneling. In the end also looked better!
We installed a gas installation, the van is a heavy drinker, 1l/8KM average.</description>

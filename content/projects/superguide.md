The idea of Superguide was to help the user choose in the ever-growing world of television, on-demand and internet. At the time Veronica Magazine already had a high rated tv-guide app with a userbase of 800.00+ users a day, but this app only covered the television aspect of the project.

I was part of a multi-disciplined team with designers, frontend and backend developers that had to rewrite the app. Add on-demand channels like Netflix and Videoland, more movie information, background stories on celebrities, series etc.

It was a fun and challenging project. The number of requests the APIs had to handle where huge. We had to connect to many different services like SAP, SAS and Gigya. We had to aggregate television and on-demand data from different providers and had to create a way to support recommendations for users.

My main focus was user/customer management. The sign-on, onboarding, in-app purchases etc. Veronica Magazine offered it's customers (the ones that read the magazine) a free upgrade to the paid version of the app. There customer data and payments were managed by SAP. I worked together with SAP a lot during this period to establish a connection between their systems (that didn't have an API) and ours, to get near real-time feedback about payment-status and customers.

It was a learning experience to connect all these different products and handle outage and unexpected exceptions in a way the customers nearly didn't notice. I learned a lot about cloud computing and failure redundant engineering.

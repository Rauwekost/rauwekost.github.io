Hello, my name is Robert den Harink. I’m a software engineer from the Netherlands. I like functional programming, mathematics and design. Occasionally  I create funky music with Ableton/vintage-organs and travel in my old 'krankenwagen' — that's German for an ambulance.

I keep this blog for things I like and love, problems I encounter or simply as a mental note. I noticed that writing things down and thinking about things from a writers perspective gives me more focus and insight on the topics I like.

In the last decade as a software engineer, data analyst and security analyst I've learned a lot and encountered different challenging problems. Now I'm using these skills and ideas to form my own startup, on which I will post more as soon as possible!

I'm available for freelance work, don't hesitate to send me a message, I can always go for a good cup of coffee!

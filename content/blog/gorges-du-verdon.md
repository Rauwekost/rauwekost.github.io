We took the 'krankenwagen' to Gorges du Verdon. It took us three days to get there. The van is pretty slow and steep hills are not its speciality, so taking pit-stops is the way to travel.

We were afraid the van could not climb the steep parts of the French Alps, but luckily we got there without trouble.

I was a lovely quiet campsite, we had a spot near the river and a lot of sunshine.

On our way back we stayed in the first world war town of Verdun. (I know, very confusing Verdon, Verdun...). We visited the great citadel and the surrounding bunkers and memorials.. impressing...

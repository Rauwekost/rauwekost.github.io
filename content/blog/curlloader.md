  Curl-loader (also known as "omes-nik" and "davilka") is an open-source tool written in C-language, simulating application load and application behaviour of thousands and tens of thousand HTTP/HTTPS and FTP/FTPS clients, each with its own source IP-address.
---

### Getting curl-loader source
Get the tarball, install some essentials, and unarchive the tar.bz
You might have to change the version number accordingly.

```bash
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/curl-loader/files/curl-loader-stable/
apt-get install libssl-dev build-essential
bunzip2 curl-loader-0.56.tar.bz2
tar xvf curl-loader-0.56.tar
```

### make, install
Now we can build curl-loader from source.

```bash
cd curl-loader-0.56
make
make install
```

### Tune the system
Update some system settings as the quick start describes

```bash
ulimit -n 10000
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_reuse
```

### Using curl-loader
Example Configuration

```ini
########### GENERAL SECTION ################################
CLIENTS_NUM_MAX=100
CLIENTS_NUM_START=2
CLIENTS_RAMPUP_INC=5
INTERFACE=eth0 #(depending on ifconfig)
NETMASK=16

IP_ADDR_MIN= <ifconfig-result>
IP_ADDR_MAX= <ifconfig-result>
IP_SHARED_NUM=100

########### URL SECTION ####################################
URL=http://<your-url>
URL_SHORT_NAME="my-site"
REQUEST_TYPE=GET
TIMER_URL_COMPLETION = 5000
TIMER_AFTER_URL_SLEEP = 500
```
> Check the curl-loader documentation or example config files for more detailed information.

Letâ€™s run a test!

```bash
curl-loader -f <config-file-path>
```

### Reading the output
After the test completes (or gets cancelled) the following files become available:

```bash
yourname.txt
yourname.ops
yourname.log
yourname.ctx
```
The one that gives the most information is the `yourname.txt` file:

```bash

### Output explanation
| Column        | Description   |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| RunTime(sec)  | Runtime in seconds |
| Appl | |
| Clients | Number of active clients |
| Req | Total number of requests |
| 1xx | Number of 1xx responses |
| 2xx | Number of 2xx responses |
| 3xx | Number of 3xx responses |
| 4xx | Number of 4xx responses |
| 5xx | Number of 5xx responses |
| Err | Number of other errors, like resolving, tcp-connect, server closing or empty responses number |
| T-Err | Url completion time expiration errors |
| D | Average application server Delay (msec), estimated as the time between HTTP request and HTTP response without taking into the account network latency |
| D-2xx | Average application server Delay for 2xx (success) HTTP-responses, as above, but only for 2xx responses. The motivation for that is that 3xx redirections and 5xx server errors/rejects may not necessarily provide a true indication of a testing server working functionality |
| Ti | Throughput in, batch average, Bytes/sec |
| To | Throughput out, batch average, Bytes/sec |

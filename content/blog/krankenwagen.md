We decided to buy an old german ambulance to turn it into a camper.

We started by stripping everything and putting in a new floor

Next up where the walls. The original plan was to use big duplex panels for a entire wall. We came to the realisation that it's near impossible to get neat, so we went with wooden paneling. In the end also looked better!

We installed a gas installation, the van is a heavy drinker, 1l/8KM average. Now we could drive to the coast of France for a little less then a airplane ticket :-)
